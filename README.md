# Exercise 1.1: Python Installation & Setup

## Description
This is the first exercise for the CareerFoundry Python Specialization. The goal was to install Python, set up a virtual environment, and run a basic script.

## Installation Steps
1. Installed Python 3.8.7 (via winget/installer).
2. Created a virtual environment `cf-python-base`.
3. Installed `ipython` and generated `requirements.txt`.
4. Verified reproducibility by creating a second environment `cf-python-copy`.

## Files Included
* `add.py`: A script that adds two user-inputted numbers.
* `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies (ipython).
* Screenshots of the installation and verification process.
