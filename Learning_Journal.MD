## Exercise 1.1 - Python Setup
**Date:** December 2025

**Experience:**
Coming from a JavaScript/React background, setting up Python felt a bit different. I learned about the importance of Python versions (3.8 vs 3.13) and how data science libraries can be picky about "bleeding edge" updates.

**What I Learned:**
* How to install specific Python versions using `winget` to avoid "End of Life" web warnings.
* The difference between `pip freeze` (exporting) and `pip install -r` (importing) for sharing environments.
* How to manage multiple Python versions on Windows using the Python Launcher (`py`).

**Goals:**
I want to master Python's data analysis libraries to complement my front-end skills.
