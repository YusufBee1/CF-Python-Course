## Exercise 1.1 - Python Setup
**Date:** December 2025

**Experience:**
Coming from a JavaScript/React background, setting up Python felt a bit different. I learned about the importance of Python versions (3.8 vs 3.13) and how data science libraries can be picky about "bleeding edge" updates.

**What I Learned:**
* How to install specific Python versions using `winget` to avoid "End of Life" web warnings.
* The difference between `pip freeze` (exporting) and `pip install -r` (importing) for sharing environments.
* How to manage multiple Python versions on Windows using the Python Launcher (`py`).

**Goals:**
I want to master Python's data analysis libraries to complement my front-end skills.

# Learning Journal - Exercise 1.2

**Date:** December 2025

**What I Learned:**
* **Dictionaries vs. Lists:** Coming from JavaScript, I realized that Python's Dictionaries are very similar to JS Objects (key-value pairs), while Lists are essentially Arrays.
* **Mutability:** Both structures are mutable, meaning I can add recipes to my list or change ingredients in a dictionary after they are created.
* **Iteration:** Using a `for` loop in Python is cleaner and more readable than the traditional `for(i=0;...)` loops I'm used to in other languages.

# Learning Journal - Exercise 1.3
**Experience:**
This was the first step into actual logic programming. I learned how to bridge the gap between user input (which is always a string) and the data types I need (integers and lists).

**Key Takeaway:**
The `.split(", ")` method is crucial for parsing comma-separated lists from users. I also got comfortable using complex `if/elif` structures to create logic gates for the difficulty ratings.
